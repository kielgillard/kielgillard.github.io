I used [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) to help build a [Scriptural Rosary web app](https://kielgillard.github.io/scriptural-rosary/). You can also [find the source on GitHub](https://github.com/kielgillard/scriptural-rosary/).

When praying the rosary, fundamentally we are [meditating on Jesus Christ](https://www.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/apost_letters/2002/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_20021016_rosarium-virginis-mariae.html). The mysteries of the rosary meditated upon can be found in Sacred Scripture. Now, sometimes, when I am praying the rosary, I find my mind looses track of the content of the mystery. I made this app in an attempt to help my recall of Sacred Scripture before - or while - I am meditating on the mysteries.

I felt fairly strongly that I should make this more widely available. I hope this app may help others.

If you do not like digital versions, you can [print this](https://catholicconvert.com/wp-content/uploads/A-Scriptural-Rosary-English.pdf) or [buy a beautiful one from Christianica Center](https://thescripturalrosary.com/products/the-scriptural-rosary).
