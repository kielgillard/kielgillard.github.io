Hi there! Here is a little [about me]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link about.markdown %}) in case you don't know (or thought you did!).

I do not know what will become of this blog. It seems there are enough voices "out there" and I do not feel like I have anything particularly insightful to add. But I think I would benefit from more practice expressing my thoughts (even if nobody is listening!) so I can have something more interesting to say in ordinary, day to day conversations. 

I feel like it takes me a little longer to express my thoughts. Unlike some other writers, I do not have the skill for fast and thoughtful content generation. So I have to choose how I spend my time. I would like to be present to my wife and kids. I would also like to spend a little more time listening and understanding others worth listening to.

How do you determine who is worth listening to? A relevant quote attributed to Arthur Schopenhauer may help:
> The only certain rule is the one that Aristotle already gave: do not dispute with anyone and everyone, but only with those people you know who are intelligent enough to avoid saying things that are so stupid as to expose themselves to humiliation, who appreciate the truth, and who gladly listen to good reasons, even when the opponent claims them, and who are balanced enough to bear a defeat when the truth is on the other side.

Having presented such a motivating case for you to read more, I limply gesture towards the [RSS feed link]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link feed.xml %}) which you can use with an RSS reader like [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com), [Feedly](https://www.feedly.com) etc. Who knows, I might actually say something interesting one day! Speaking of RSS, Feedly etc, I hope you can apply Arthur's advice to some of the sources of news you read, too. If you get your news exclusively through social media, are the algorithms selecting sources with the same intelligence and ethic?

Finally, as I fumble around with words and ideas, I expect to get things wrong. But I want to learn and be better. So I am open to thoughtful and constructive critical feedback. There will never be comments on posts, but you can reach out to me by email (if you join my first and last name with a dot at gmail), or through social media or respond on your own blog.
