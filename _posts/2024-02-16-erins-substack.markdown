My beautiful bride, Erin Gillard, has a free Substack (a blog) titled “[By His Grace and For His Glory](https://eringillard.substack.com)”.

I commend it to you because she desires to share the beautiful things God is doing in her life with all, so all — including you! — can be encouraged in your relationship with God. The same and only God who continuously sustains contingent beings in existence and became incarnate in Jesus Christ so that by participating in the divine-human nature of Christ in the sacrament of Baptism we can become who we were made to be — [partakers in the life of the Trinity](https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-4.htm).

I’m an incredibly blessed man to married to her as we help each other become who we were made to be. Dearest Erin, thank you for your love. I love you. If being married to you is this great now, how great will it be to spend eternity partaking in the life of the Trinity together?!
