I am going to try journaling as I read [Dr Edward Feser](http://www.edwardfeser.com)’s latest book, [Immortal Souls](https://booko.com.au/9783868386059). A sample of it can be read on [Google Books](https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/Immortal_Souls/X-ceEQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover).

I am thinking the structure of each post will be as follows. It is [inspired by Mortimer Adler’s “essence of active reading”](https://booko.com.au/9780671212094). Roughly, I expect each post will correspond to a single chapter. I’ll begin with a bit of a summary about what the chapter was about, then iterate and relate its main points and finally share some thoughts about it. I do not know if I’ll have much to share.

I hope this journaling will help improve my comprehension of the book and develop skills that help me become a more intelligent reader.
