Hi there, I'm Kiel Gillard.

- ✝️ I am a Roman Catholic.
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 I have an incredible wife and two children. 
- 📱I know a thing or two about iOS & macOS development. 
- 🤔 I like to learn and think about things.
- 💌 I am trying to be better and appreciate honest, constructive feedback.
- 🗣 My name is [pronouced "Kyle"](https://www.howtopronounce.com/kyle) — rhymes with smile (or bile!).

I work at [Deputy](https://www.deputy.com), helping shift workers make a living and business owners build thriving, compliant workplaces.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/kielgillard) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kielgillard/).
